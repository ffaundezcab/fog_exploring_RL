"""GATE script for Lecture 5, Part 2 -- does a standard DQN solve the
realistic microbe environment?

Per the build plan: train DQN on the realistic microbe, MULTI-SEED, and report
diagnostics. If the DQN does not reliably solve it, the environment must be
redesigned before any lecture markdown is written.

Setup
-----
Place ``realistic_microbe.py`` in ``rlc/envs/`` and ``dqn.py`` in
``rlc/agents/``, then run this script from the repository root:

    python gate_dqn_microbe.py

The three ``from rlc...`` imports below assume that layout; adjust them if your
tree differs. ``NormalizeObs`` is inlined here so the script does not depend on
the repo copy.

Cost: order of one to a few minutes per seed on CPU. Reduce N_SEEDS or
N_EPISODES below if needed -- partial output is still informative, since each
seed is printed as it finishes.

What to report back
-------------------
The full printout: the per-seed learning curves and final assessments, and the
across-seed summary.
